# Public Assets

## Static Files
Located in `public/` and served from the web root:
- `manifest.json` — PWA metadata placeholder for local dev
- `sw.js` — service worker placeholder to avoid 404 noise
- `perf.js` — placeholder to avoid 404 noise
- SVG assets for UI usage

## Notes
These files are intentionally minimal and can be expanded for production use.
